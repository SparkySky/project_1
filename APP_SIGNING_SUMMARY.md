## üö® CRITICAL: What You Must Do NOW

### Step 1: Generate Your Keystore (5 minutes)

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\alvin\Desktop\Conflict\project_1\android\app\keystore

& "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr\bin\keytool.exe" -genkey -v -keystore mysafezone-release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias mysafezone
```

**Answer the prompts:**
- Keystore password: Choose a strong password (min 6 chars)
- Your name: Your name or "MySafeZone Team"
- Organizational unit: "Development"
- Organization: "meowResQ"
- City: Your city
- State: Your state/province
- Country: Your 2-letter country code (PH, US, UK, etc.)

**üíæ WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY!**

---

### Step 2: Update keystore.properties (2 minutes)

Edit: `android/keystore.properties`

Replace `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE` and `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual passwords:

```properties
storePassword=YourActualPassword123
keyPassword=YourActualPassword123
keyAlias=mysafezone
storeFile=app/keystore/mysafezone-release.jks
```

---

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration (2 minutes)

Run a test build:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

If successful, you'll see: `‚úì Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

---

### Step 4: BACKUP YOUR KEYSTORE! (10 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP!**

Copy `android/app/keystore/mysafezone-release.jks` to:

1. **External USB Drive** (encrypted if possible)
2. **Cloud Storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox - in encrypted folder)
3. **Password Manager** (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
4. **Another Computer** (if available)
5. **Email to Yourself** (encrypted attachment)

Also save your credentials (passwords) in the same locations!

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you lose this keystore, you CANNOT update your app on AGC Connect ever again!**

## üéØ Next Steps for AGC Connect Publishing

Once keystore is set up and backed up:

1. ‚úÖ App Signing - **DONE** (You're here!)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Create Privacy Policy (see main guide)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Prepare store assets (screenshots, icon, description)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Build release APK/AAB
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Upload to AGC Connect
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Submit for review

---

## üîç Verify Everything Works

### Check 1: Keystore Exists
```powershell
Test-Path "C:\Users\alvin\Desktop\Conflict\project_1\android\app\keystore\mysafezone-release.jks"
# Should return: True
```

### Check 2: Build Succeeds
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
# Should complete without errors
```

### Check 3: Git Protection
```bash
git status
# Should NOT show: keystore.properties, *.jks files
```

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### "keytool not recognized"
- Java/JDK not installed or not in PATH
- Use full path: `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr\bin\keytool.exe`

### "keystore password incorrect"
- Double-check `keystore.properties` file
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes
- Password must match what you entered during generation

### "keystore not found"
- Run Step 1 to generate the keystore
- Verify file exists: `android/app/keystore/mysafezone-release.jks`

### ProGuard Build Errors
- Check `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`
- Temporarily disable: Set `isMinifyEnabled = false` in build.gradle.kts
