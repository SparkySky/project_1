# Account Linking & Email Integration Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation adds email field to CloudDB and enables automatic account linking when users sign in with different authentication methods (Email + Password vs Huawei ID).

---

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Email Field in CloudDB**
- Added `email` field to the `Users` model
- Email is now stored in CloudDB for account linking purposes
- Email is displayed in the Profile page (read-only)

### 2. **Automatic Account Linking** 🔗
When a user:
1. Registers with email (e.g., `user@example.com`)
2. Later signs in with Huawei ID using the **same email**

**The system will automatically:**
- ✅ Detect the existing account with that email
- ✅ Migrate all user data (username, phone, district, preferences, etc.)
- ✅ Delete the old email-based account
- ✅ Link everything to the new Huawei ID account
- ✅ Show a success message: "Account linked! Your data has been preserved."

### 3. **Email Display in Profile**
- Email field is now **read-only** (cannot be edited)
- Shows a 🔒 lock icon to indicate it's locked
- Displays helper text: "Email from Huawei ID" or "Email from Email"
- Email is fetched from the authentication provider (AGCUser)

## ⚠️ Important: CloudDB Schema Update Required

### You MUST update the CloudDB schema in Huawei AGConnect Console:

1. **Go to Huawei AGConnect Console**
   - Navigate to: Cloud DB → Object Types → Users

2. **Add Email Field**
   ```
   Field Name: email
   Field Type: String
   Required: No (optional)
   Indexed: Yes (recommended for faster lookups)
   ```

3. **Update the schema**
   - Export the updated schema
   - Apply it to your Cloud DB zone

### Without this update, the app may crash when trying to save/query email!

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: New User with Huawei ID
1. Sign in with Huawei ID (email: `test@example.com`)
2. ✅ Email should appear in Profile page (read-only)
3. ✅ Email should be stored in CloudDB

### Test Case 2: Account Linking
1. Register with email: `user@example.com` + password
2. Fill in profile data (phone, district, etc.)
3. Log out
4. Sign in with Huawei ID using **same email**: `user@example.com`
5. ✅ Should see "Account linked! Your data has been preserved."
6. ✅ All previous data should be preserved
7. ✅ Can now use Huawei ID for all future logins

### Test Case 3: Read-Only Email Field
1. Go to Profile page
2. Try to edit the email field
3. ✅ Should not be editable (read-only)
4. ✅ Should show lock icon 🔒
5. ✅ Should show helper text: "Email from [provider]"

## 🔍 How Account Linking Works

### The Logic Flow:

```
User logs in with Huawei ID (email: user@example.com)
    ↓
Check: Does CloudDB have a user with this email?
    ↓
YES → Found existing account with different UID
    ↓
    ├─ Copy all data from old account
    ├─ Update UID to new Huawei ID UID
    ├─ Delete old email-based account
    ├─ Save merged account
    └─ Show success message
    ↓
NO → Create new account as normal
```

### Debug Logs:
When account linking happens, you'll see:
```
[CloudDB] 🔗 Account linking detected!
[CloudDB] 📧 Email account UID: [old-uid]
[CloudDB] 🆔 Current Huawei ID UID: [new-uid]
[CloudDB] ✅ Old account deleted: [old-uid]
[CloudDB] 🎉 Account successfully linked and migrated!
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Profile Page - Email Field:

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📧  user@example.com         ✏️    │  ← Editable
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📧  user@example.com         🔒    │  ← Read-only
│     Email from Huawei ID            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Update CloudDB schema in AGConnect Console (add email field)
2. ✅ Build and test the app
3. ✅ Test account linking with different scenarios
4. ✅ Monitor debug logs for any issues

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
- Check CloudDB schema is updated
- Verify email field is indexed in CloudDB
- Check debug logs for linking messages
- Ensure both auth methods use the same email address

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **Seamless Experience**: Users can switch between auth methods without losing data  
✅ **Data Integrity**: All user data is preserved during migration  
✅ **Security**: Email cannot be edited, maintaining auth provider trust  
✅ **Transparency**: Users are informed when accounts are linked  
✅ **Flexibility**: Users can use their preferred login method
