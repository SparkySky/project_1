# Tutorial Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete tutorial system has been implemented for the MYSafeZone app, covering three main pages: Homepage, Lodge Incident, and Profile. The tutorials guide users through each page with a **continuous flow** on first app use, with interactive walkthroughs that simulate scrolling actions and explain all key features.

## Tutorial Flow Sequence

### First-Time User Experience (Continuous Flow)
The tutorials work as a **complete onboarding sequence** when the user first uses the app:

1. **Homepage Tutorial** → Explains map, safety trigger, incidents, filter, chatbot
   - User completes homepage tutorial
   - Final step guides user to Lodge page
   
2. **Lodge Tutorial** (Automatic) → Appears when user navigates to Lodge from homepage tutorial
   - Explains incident reporting features
   - User completes lodge tutorial
   
3. **Profile Tutorial** (Automatic) → Appears when user navigates to Profile after lodge tutorial
   - Explains profile settings and account management
   - Final step congratulates user on completing all tutorials

### Key Change: Continuous Flow Logic
Instead of each page checking independently if the tutorial was completed, the tutorials now check:
- **Homepage tutorial**: Shows on first app launch
- **Lodge tutorial**: Shows ONLY if homepage is completed but lodge is not (first time flow)
- **Profile tutorial**: Shows ONLY if lodge is completed but profile is not (first time flow)

This ensures a smooth, continuous tutorial experience on first app use, then tutorials can be replayed individually later.

- Progress indicator (dots showing current step)
- Skip button (close tutorial anytime)

- Next/Done button (continue or complete)

#### Tutorial Managers
Each tutorial has a manager class with:
- `hasCompletedTutorial()` - Check if user completed tutorial
- `resetTutorial()` - Reset for replay
- `showTutorialIfNeeded()` - Auto-show on first visit
- `showTutorial()` - Force show tutorial

### User Experience

#### First-Time Users
1. App opens → Homepage tutorial starts automatically
2. Navigate to Lodge → Lodge tutorial starts
3. Navigate to Profile → Profile tutorial starts

#### Returning Users
- Tutorials don't auto-play after completion
- Users can replay tutorials from Profile page
- Tutorial progress saved in SharedPreferences

#### Tutorial Persistence
```dart
// Keys used for persistence:

```

## Technical Details

### Animation & Smooth Scrolling

### Highlighting System
```dart
HighlightArea(
  top: appBarHeight + statusBarHeight + offset,
  height: elementHeight,
  left: horizontalPosition, // optional
  width: elementWidth, // optional
)
```

### Tutorial Card Positioning
