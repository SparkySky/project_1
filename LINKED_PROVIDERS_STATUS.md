## ⚠️ Error: "Provider User Already Linked"

### What This Means:
The Huawei ID you're trying to link is **already associated with another AGConnect account**.

### Why This Happens:
```
Scenario 1:
├─ Account A: user1@example.com (Email)
└─ Account B: user2@example.com (Email) + Huawei ID (John)

You try to link "Huawei ID (John)" to Account A
❌ ERROR: This Huawei ID is already linked to Account B
```

**AGConnect Rule:** Each Huawei ID can only be linked to **ONE** AGConnect account.
